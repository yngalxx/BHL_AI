# BHL_AI 2021

The effects of my and my friends' work during the Best Hacking League Hackaton organized by the Warsaw University of Technology

AI category task which main goal was to create a model that classifies user activity based on smartphone sensor data.

Final.ipynb - it's our final and full apporach, contains EDA, data prepocessing, modelling and evaluation

My working directory is "alex". I was working mainly on modeling. I created models from logistic regression, to neural networks and the catboost classifier, to ensembling methods (stacking). In the end, we decided to use catboost model. I was also partially involved in data preprocessing and model evaluation.
